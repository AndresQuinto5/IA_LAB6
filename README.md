# Connect Four Agent using Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Introduction

This project focuses on implementing an agent capable of playing Connect Four using the Minimax algorithm along with the efficiency technique of alpha-beta pruning. The aim is to create an AI agent capable of playing against a human player or another AI agent.

## Requirements

- Programming language: Python

## Instructions

1. **Game Rules**: Familiarize yourself with the rules of Connect Four. You can find the rules [Reglas](https://regentsctr.uni.edu/sites/default/files/games/Games/Connect_Four/Connect_Four_Rules.pdf).

2. **Algorithm Selection**: Utilize the Minimax algorithm along with alpha-beta pruning for the agent's decision-making process.

3. **Board Representation**: Implement the game board and rule validation. You can either use code from other sources (with proper citation), utilize libraries, use AI-generated code (with proper citation), or develop your own.

4. **Agent Functionality**:
   - Implement the agent with the Minimax algorithm.
   - Include the option to enable or disable alpha-beta pruning.
   - Provide the following gameplay options:
     - Human player vs. AI player (the one you programmed)
     - AI player vs. AI player (two instances of your agent created with Minimax)

5. **Testing and Evaluation**:
   - Record a video demonstrating the following:
     - A game of human vs. AI player.
     - At least 10 games of AI without alpha-beta pruning vs. AI with alpha-beta pruning.
   - Ensure the video does not exceed 10 minutes in total.
   - Within the video timeframe, mention:
     - General behavior of your agent.
     - Explanation of why the AI vs. AI game resulted in the winner with or without alpha-beta pruning. Discuss how the presence or absence of this strategy affected the winning agent.

## Video Demonstration

A video demonstration of the project implementation, gameplay, and evaluation can be found [Video](https://youtu.be/rUCwaak3Ljs).

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Connect Four agent utilizing the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The agent's performance is evaluated through various gameplay scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness and the impact of alpha-beta pruning on its decision-making process.
